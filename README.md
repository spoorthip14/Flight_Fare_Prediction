# Flight_Fare_Prediction
This project focuses on predicting flight fares using machine learning techniques. Leveraging historical flight data, features such as departure,airline, route &amp; other relevant factors will be analyzed to build predictive models. The project will involve data preprocessing, feature engineering &amp; model selection to achieve accurate fare predictions
